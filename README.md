# # orthogonal checkers

## How to Play:
1. Go to https://cattacocattaco.github.io/Orthogonal-Checkers/
2. Choose your game settings
    * I recomend leaving the defaults the first time
3. Press play

## What this is:
It's like normal checkers but I removed all of the black squares that are inaccessable were removed. The squares are than moved so that what were previously diagonal neighbors are now orthogonal neighbors and the checkers move orthogonally instead of diagonally. It is functionally equivalent to normal checkers but it gets rid of the useless tiles. This also has an option for a hexagonal grid and you can make the board larger.
